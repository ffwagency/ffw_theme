# Purpose of 'prp_theme' project

* Wide discussion, to result in a single FE standard (theme) to be used.

### Benefits

* Easier and more pleasant work in FE department.
* Easy switch between projects. Anyone should be able to work on any project.
* Better quality of the product and personal improvement.

### What could be done?

* Drupal, .NET, and Design (prototype) departments could use single FE 'theme'.
* Single tool for process automation (CSS, JavaScript, style guides etc.), e.g. Grunt.
* Standardized directory structure and more standards (upon discussion). GitLab.

### Who should work on this?

* Everybody could help in the process, but experience in the field is a must.
* We should keep the Design department informed and (probably) listen to them.

### When could this be ready to see in action?

* Depends on the time dedicated to work on this.
* Could be 1st of July 2015 (see previous one).
